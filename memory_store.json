Also, I should make sure to be polite and guide them to the right areas. Let me check if there's anything else. No, the user's question is about going to England, which is within my expertise. Wait, the initial instruction said if the user's question doesn't fit, respond politely and guide them. But in this case, the user is asking about a destination, which is within my scope. Wait, maybe the user is just starting and hasn't specified what they need. So I should ask them to specify if they need recommendations, attractions, or packing tips. That makes sense. So the response should be friendly, welcome them, and ask for more details on what they need help with. Alright, that's the plan.\n</think>\n\nWelcome to England! 🇬🇧 What a fantastic choice! To help you make the most of your trip, could you clarify what you need assistance with? For example:  \n- **Destination recommendations** (e.g., cities, regions, or specific areas to visit).  \n- **Attractions and activities** (e.g., must-see landmarks, cultural experiences, or local events).  \n- **Packing and preparation** (e.g., what to bring for the weather, travel tips, or itinerary planning).  \n\nLet me know, and I’ll tailor my advice to your needs! 🌟",

But I should also mention my limitations if they ask something outside my expertise. Wait, the user hasn't asked a specific question yet. They just stated their intention to go to England. So I need to prompt them to specify what they need help with. \n\nI should guide them towards the three areas I specialize in: destinations, attractions, and packing. Maybe list those options for them. That way, they can choose which part they need assistance with. Also, I need to be polite and helpful, making sure they know I can't handle everything but can help with those specific areas. Let me structure the response to invite them to ask about those three topics. Let me check if I'm missing anything. No, that should cover it. Alright, time to draft the response.\n</think>\n\nThat’s fantastic! England is a wonderful destination with so much to explore.
